A little gimmick I made as a bonus joke for a teacher's assignment.

Clouds are generated randomly and the sun rotates around a broken axis.
I intend to add a few more advanced concepts in the future to play around with QML's path rendering capabilities.  

This program uses Qt libraries licensed under GPLv3.

Enjoy!

### Building on Windows
Use the installer to get the Qt binaries and run from Qt creator. I'll properly add the DLLs later lol.

### Building on Linux (untested)
Install Qt (prolly already there), the dev packages and qmake, then build with qmake. Will probably work.
